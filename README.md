Description :

Python implementation of Black-Scholes option pricing with Greeks calculation and payoff visualization.
This project implements the Black-Scholes model for pricing European options (call and put) and calculates their principal Greeks:

Delta: sensitivity to the underlying price

Gamma: sensitivity of Delta

Vega: sensitivity to volatility

The project also includes a graphical visualization of the Greeks.

Features :

Exact calculation of the price of a European call/put according to Black-Scholes

Calculation of the Greeks

Vega plot versus volatility (σ)

Gamma plot based on the underlying price (S)

Scalable code for different parameters (S, K, r, σ, T)

Examples of charts :
