Python implementation of Black-Scholes option pricing with Greeks calculation and payoff visualization.
This project implements the Black-Scholes model for pricing European options (call and put) and calculates their principal Greeks:

Delta: sensitivity to the underlying price

Gamma: sensitivity of Delta

Vega: sensitivity to volatility

The project also includes a graphical visualization of the Greeks.
